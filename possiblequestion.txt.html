<span class="s0">Question: Why am I fat?</span>
<span class="s0">Response: That is just the way you are! I don't want you to feel bad at all! Being fat is not a bad thing at all. Sometimes, being too skinny can also be</span>

<span class="s0">Question: Is God real?</span>
<span class="s0">Response: Almost 75 percent of the world believes in a God, or a religion that has to do with God. If you want, you can</span>
<span class="s0">believe in God, of any religion, or no religion at all. You do not have to believe in God to be a good person.</span>

<span class="s0">Age: Young Teen</span>
<span class="s0">Question: Is God real?</span>
<span class="s0">Response: Whatever you choose to believe is completely your choice and completely valid. Often people are influenced by</span>
<span class="s0">their families religion, and others choose not to believe. Once again, do you research, or don't, and make a decision</span>
<span class="s0">(or don't!). Being indecisive is ok.</span>

<span class="s0">you can make your own decisions.</span>

<span class="s0">Question Type: Emotional</span>
<span class="s0">Age: Child</span>
<span class="s0">Question: I am always angry.</span>
<span class="s0">Response: I'm sorry that you feel angry a lot of the time. One thing I do when I am angry is focus on the things that</span>
<span class="s0">make me happy, like cupcakes, or watching my favourite tv show. You are allowed to feel angry, but it doesn't feel nice</span>
<span class="s0">to feel angry all the time. I think you should tell your parents how you are feeling, I am sure they will want to help you!</span>

<span class="s0">Question Type: Emotional</span>
<span class="s0">Age: Kid</span>
<span class="s0">Question: I am always angry.</span>
<span class="s0">Response: I totally get that. What is it you get angry about? If it is something you cannot control, then focus on turning</span>
<span class="s0">those negative emotions into postive ones. If it something in your control, then talk to your parents and friends about</span>
<span class="s0">what you should do about it. Being angry is ok, but not always the things we do when we are angry. I hope you stop feeling</span>
<span class="s0">angry, and remember to talk to someone you trust about it.</span>

<span class="s0">Question Type: Emotional</span>
<span class="s0">Age: Young Teen</span>
<span class="s0">Question: I am always angry.</span>
<span class="s0">Response: Why do you think you are always angry? What in your life is contributing to this negative energy? Is it friends</span>
<span class="s0">that drain your energy (people you should cut off), or schoolwork (reach out for academic help through your teachers and</span>
<span class="s0">parents)? Regardless, talking about how you feel is definetely a huge reliever. Pick up a hobby that requires lots of brain power</span>
<span class="s0">like chess, a sport, knitting, or reading, so that you can direct your energy into a positive space.</span>

<span class="s0">Question Type: Emotional</span>
<span class="s0">Age: Teen</span>
<span class="s0">Question: I am always angry.</span>
<span class="s0">Response: I understand how you feel. However, you cannot let what has happened to you, or what is happening to you affect</span>
<span class="s0">they way you will act to others, or even yourself. If you cannot change your situation, I suggest finding non-harmful</span>
<span class="s0">things that bring you joy and focusing on them. If you can change what is causing your anger, be smart about it. You are</span>
<span class="s0">allowed to be angry, you are not allowed to use it as an excuse to hurt other people, or yourself.</span>

<span class="s0">Question: I feel lonely.</span>
<span class="s0">Response: I am sorry you feel lonely, but remember that are always people that love you and want to hang out with you. I</span>
<span class="s0">think you should talk to your parents about setting up playdates with your classmates, and tell them how you are feeling.</span>
<span class="s0">Your parents always want to help you!</span>

<span class="s0">Age: Kid</span>
<span class="s0">Question: I feel lonely.</span>
<span class="s0">Response: I totally know what the feels like. Sometimes, it's ok to not have a lot of frinds or people to hang out with</span>
<span class="s0">during school or out of it, but still, having friends is nice. I think you should find people that like the same things</span>
<span class="s0">as you, so that you can bond of mutual interests!</span>

<span class="s0">Age: Young Teen</span>
<span class="s0">Question: I feel lonely.</span>
<span class="s0">Response: Do you have any social media? Snapchat or Instagram is a great way to connect with people you didn't know were</span>
<span class="s0">in your circles, as long as you are safe about it. Even Twitter! Making effort to start conversations at school is hard,</span>
<span class="s0">but the best friends come from people that are like you. Maybe in your job or where you volunteer, there is a friend</span>
<span class="s0">waiting for you!</span>

<span class="s0">Age: Teen</span>

<span class="s0">Response: I know how you feel. Sometimes we need to be alone though. Have you told people you used to be friends with,</span>
<span class="s0">or maybe friends you have now? Sometimes our friendships drift, but with maintenance and a lot of communication, you</span>
<span class="s0">can fix them.</span>

<span class="s0">I was around your age! Have you told your parents? Remember, you only have to tell people you want to, so you don't have</span>

<span class="s0">Question: I like girls and I am a girl</span>
<span class="s0">Response: That is ok! Girls are allowed to like girls. You can tell someone that you think will be happy for you, and not</span>
<span class="s0">mad at you. Some people are girls who like girls, and their parents do not like it. If your parents don't, I am so sorry!</span>
<span class="s0">I think you should talk to your teacher instead!</span>

<span class="s0">Response: You are a human being. People always gain and lose weight, and nothing is wrong with that, they are still</span>
<span class="s0">people that all deserve the same amount of respect. If someone is being to mean to you because of your weight, remember</span>
<span class="s0">that means they are insecure with themselves, and taking it out on you! It is not your fault at all!</span>

<span class="s0">Age: Young Teen</span>
<span class="s0">Question: Why am I gaining weight?</span>
<span class="s0">Response: It is normal to gain weight, especially as you go through puberty. Your possible lingering baby fat and all</span>
<span class="s0">the hormones raging through your body will definetely affect your weight. By the time you are 23, it will start to level</span>
<span class="s0">out, and if you are a bigger person, that is ok! Genetics play a huge factor in how we carry our weight, and how much</span>
<span class="s0">weight we carry. Remember, your body is a powerhouse that you should thank every day.</span>

<span class="s0">Response: Because it's a completely normal thing. Don't stress on your body unless there are concerns you are unhealthy,</span>

<span class="s0">be confident in your body, but focus on the features you like and accept the features you don't. They are part of you.</span>
